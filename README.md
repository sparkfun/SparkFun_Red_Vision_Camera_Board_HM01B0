The SparkFun Red Vision Camera Board - HM01B0 is a breakout board for the HM01B0 320 x 320 color camera module from Himax<sup>&copy;</sup>. The Camera Board breaks out all the pins from the HM01B0's ribbon cable to three sets of 0.1"-spaced plated through-hole (PTH) headers for users to easily access. We designed the Red Vision Camera Board - HM01B0 to work both as a standalone breakout board and also as a compliment to the [SparkFun Red Vision Touch Display for Pico](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-red-vision-touch-display-for-pico.html) to add live image processing as well as advanced features including object and contour detection among others to the [Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP) Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/experiential-robotics-platform-xrp-kit.html) using a SparkFun MicroPython port of the popular OpenCV image processing library. We've included both of these boards in the [SparkFun Red Vision Kit for XRP ](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-pico-vision-kit-for-xrp.html) for those who'd like to get everything they need to quickly and easily add a camera and touchscreen display to their XRP Robot with no soldering required. **Note:** This standalone version of the Red Vision Camera Board - HM01B0 does *not* come with headers soldered to the board.
